I'll admit, writing tests is difficult to do. Writing the test often isn't difficult, it's just code after all. However, writing a *test first* is a habit that's tricky to form. However, if you do test-driven development (TDD), chances are that you'll develop a nicer API. After all, your test will act as a client to your API, and you'll see what code looks like for your users.

A couple of months ago, I wrote posts about developing a [cryptocurrency wealth tracking PWA](/blog/2018/01/18/cryptocurrency-pwa-secured-by-okta) and [storing your holdings as Okta custom profile attributes](/blog/2018/01/23/replace-local-storage-with-okta-profile-attributes). To show you how to write tests for the back-end and front-end components, I recruited [Brian Demers](https://twitter.com/briandemers) to help me. Brian is the lead developer on Okta's Java SDKs and a fun guy to hang out with.

In this tutorial, you'll see how to implement many aspects of testing a modern application:

* Unit testing the `HoldingsController` with JUnit
* Mocking Okta's Java SDK to return expected results with Mockito
* Mocking Okta's API with WireMock for integration tests
* Unit testing Angular components with Jasmine
* Driving and testing your UI with Protractor
* Continuous Integration and Delivery
  * Travis CI
  * Jenkins
  
I like to call this a hitchhiker's guide because you can jump into any section of this guide and just learn how to test those particular components. If you have any suggestions for improving a particular section, please let us know so we can improve it!

We hope you've enjoyed this hitchhiker's guide to testing Java and TypeScript applications. It's a really good feeling when your codebase has high test coverage and you're able to refactor by tweaking your code and adjusting your tests.
